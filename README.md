In my graduating year of high school I took an unorthodox option instead of a final exam for my computer programming class. I convinced my teacher to allow me and a friend with very different skills to create a massive video game instead.

I was the primary coder/creator of the game, my friend Joel created most of the art for the game.
A week before the due date all groups dissolved and the individuals were tasked with adding to/completing the game. This is my version which I am very proud of.
I have added my formal write-up to the game below for those interested.



Design - Planing out the game
    Our idea was a top down RPG style game with a complete story, original artwork and a unique boss fight unlike anything we could have programmed prior to this class. It would have a lot of levels with high mob-density and intense scenarios.

How we met the criteria 
    This semester we learned how to do the following that involve making a game, 
Create and implement Classes 
Create sprites and use collision detection
Use/Create modules and other libraries
    All of this knowledge was applied to our game. We have a variety of classes as well as many methods that belong to those classes. We also successfully used sprites and even animated them in the process. We used a new module aside from what we learned in class and got it working perfectly into our game while making it compatible with the other libraries we used. Our game is complete and we have fulfilled our own expectations and then some in the time we were given.



Challenges
    Pyganim - This was a new module for us with new syntax. We had to first learn the syntax and then learn how to use the module properly. The hardest part however was incorporating the new module into the game. The module did not create sprites but created just their animations. This caused us to have to give everything a sprite, re-size hotboxes and rewrite the AI to play the animations properly.

    AI Tracking - We struggled with enemies following our player. It was simple to have them trace our x and y coordinates but we wanted to have varying methods of monsters finding us and the great variety made us expend a lot of extra time.

    Attacking - Our attacking hit box was a monster in it of itself. We struggled greatly with the range at which we attack and the collision of the monsters themselves.


Successes
    Main loop - The games main loop is something we never had much of a problem with. Everything ran smoothly on our timers and each cut scene always met its mark.  

    Attacking Animation - The attacking animation came together really well, it looks smooth and is a huge improvement over there not being an animation.

    Monster Animation - The monsters move very smoothly and properly, they look like actually monsters that could be in a real AAA game. All around we are really pleased with the quality of the animations.

    Transitions -  The game has very smooth transitions between levels that feels like an actually loading screen and are not too drawn out thanks to our optimization efforts.
